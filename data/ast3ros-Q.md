# [L-01] Use of ecrecover is Susceptible to Signature Malleability

The built-in EVM pre-compiled `ecrecover` featured in the function is susceptible to signature malleability due to non-unique v and s (which may not always be in the lower half of the modulo set) values, possibly leading to replay attacks. Elsewhere if devoid of the adoption of nonces, this could prove a vulnerability when not carefully used.

        address recoveredAddress = ecrecover(digest, v, r, s);

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider using OpenZeppelinâ€™s ECDSA library which has been time tested in preventing this malleability where possible.
