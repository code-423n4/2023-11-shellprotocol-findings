## Impact
In this revised function, if computeInputAmount is called, it will revert the transaction and throw the ComputeInputAmountError, which makes it clear that the error originated from this specific function. This approach is beneficial for maintaining clarity in your contract's operation and can be particularly useful during testing and troubleshooting. Remember that descriptive errors can significantly improve the maintainability and readability of your contract.

## Proof of Concept
Define a Custom Error:
At the top of your contract, define a custom error that describes the specific issue related to computeInputAmount. For example:

// Custom error for computeInputAmount function
error ComputeInputAmountError();
Modify the computeInputAmount Function:
Use the custom error in the revert statement of the computeInputAmount function:


function computeInputAmount(
    uint256 inputToken,
    uint256 outputToken,
    uint256 outputAmount,
    address userAddress,
    bytes32 maximumInputAmount
)
    external
    override
    onlyOcean
    returns (uint256 inputAmount)
{
    revert ComputeInputAmountError(); // Using the custom error
}


## Tools Used

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
I added a custom error definition named ComputeInputAmountError at the top of the contract.
Purpose: This error provides a specific and identifiable message that is associated with the computeInputAmount function. It helps in pinpointing the exact source of an error if the function fails.
Modified the computeInputAmount Function:

I replaced the generic revert() statement in the computeInputAmount function with revert ComputeInputAmountError();.
Purpose: Using this custom error in the revert statement makes the error more descriptive. When the function is called and it triggers a revert, it now throws ComputeInputAmountError. This makes it clear that the error originated from an issue within the computeInputAmount function.
These changes were made to enhance clarity and debugging efficiency. In Solidity, custom errors are a cleaner way to handle errors compared to generic revert messages. They consume less gas and provide a clearer understanding of what went wrong, which is particularly useful during development, testing, and in production environments to quickly identify and resolve issues.
