## Impact
These changes are made to enforce the invariant that the total supply of tokens should always correctly increase by the minted amount and decrease by the burned amount, thus preserving the consistency and reliability of the contract's token supply accounting.

Implementing checks in the _mint and _burn functions to ensure that the totalSupply of a token correctly reflects the minted or burned amount is an excellent practice for maintaining the integrity of the token's supply.
## Proof of Concept
Implementation for _mint Function:
Record the Pre-Mint Supply: 
Before minting new tokens, capture the totalSupply of the token. This is the totalSupply(token)_{beforeMint}.

1. Perform the Mint Operation: 
Execute the minting operation which increases the number of tokens for the given tokenId.

Post-Mint Validation: 
After minting, assert that the new totalSupply of the token (totalSupply(token)_{afterMint}) is equal to the totalSupply(token)_{beforeMint} plus the mintAmount.

function _mint(address account, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes memory data) internal virtual override {
    uint256 beforeMintSupply = totalSupply(id);
    super._mint(account, id, amount, data);
    uint256 afterMintSupply = totalSupply(id);
    assert(afterMintSupply == beforeMintSupply + amount);
}

2. Implementation for _burn Function:
Record the Pre-Burn Supply: 
Before burning tokens, capture the totalSupply of the token. This is the totalSupply(token)_{beforeBurn}.

Perform the Burn Operation: 
Execute the burning operation which decreases the number of tokens for the given tokenId.

Post-Burn Validation: 
After burning, assert that the new totalSupply of the token (totalSupply(token)_{afterBurn}) is equal to the totalSupply(token)_{beforeBurn} minus the burnAmount.

function _burn(address account, uint256 id, uint256 amount) internal virtual override {
    uint256 beforeBurnSupply = totalSupply(id);
    super._burn(account, id, amount);
    uint256 afterBurnSupply = totalSupply(id);
    assert(afterBurnSupply == beforeBurnSupply - amount);
}
## Tools Used

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
In the suggested changes to the _mint and _burn functions, I introduced additional steps to perform checks before and after the minting and burning operations. These changes are crucial to ensure the integrity and consistency of the token's supply in the contract. Here's a breakdown of the changes and the rationale behind them:

Pre-Mint Total Supply Capture: 
Before minting new tokens, the total supply of the token (totalSupply(token)_{beforeMint}) is recorded. This step captures the state of the total supply before any changes occur.

Minting Operation: 
The function then proceeds with the actual minting operation, which increases the token balance of a specified account.

Post-Mint Validation: 
After minting, the function asserts that the new total supply (totalSupply(token)_{afterMint}) equals the sum of the totalSupply(token)_{beforeMint} and the mintAmount. This assertion ensures that the total supply reflects the addition of the newly minted tokens.
uint256 beforeMintSupply = totalSupply(id);
super._mint(account, id, amount, data);
uint256 afterMintSupply = totalSupply(id);
assert(afterMintSupply == beforeMintSupply + amount);

Changes in _burn Function:
Pre-Burn Total Supply Capture: Similar to the mint function, the total supply of the token before burning (totalSupply(token)_{beforeBurn}) is recorded.

Burning Operation: The function executes the burning operation, which decreases the token balance of a specified account.

Post-Burn Validation: 
After burning, the function asserts that the new total supply (totalSupply(token)_{afterBurn}) equals the totalSupply(token)_{beforeBurn} minus the burnAmount. This check ensures that the total supply accurately reflects the reduction due to the burning of tokens.
uint256 beforeBurnSupply = totalSupply(id);
super._burn(account, id, amount);
uint256 afterBurnSupply = totalSupply(id);
assert(afterBurnSupply == beforeBurnSupply - amount);


Rationale Behind the Changes:
Accuracy and Integrity:
These checks are vital for maintaining accurate accounting of the token supply within the contract. They ensure that the total supply of tokens always correctly reflects the minting and burning actions.

Preventing Inconsistencies: 
Without these checks, there's a risk that discrepancies in token supply could occur, potentially leading to severe issues in token economics and trust in the contract.

Security Considerations: 
The added assertions act as safeguards against potential bugs or unexpected behavior in the contract, which might lead to incorrect token supply calculations.
