My Shell Protocol has revealed several findings related to security, consistency, and functionality. Here's a summary of the key findings:

Normalization of ERC-20 Balances: 
Implemented checks for normalizing ERC-20 token balances to 18 decimals, addressing medium-risk concerns. This ensures consistent handling of various ERC-20 tokens within the contract.

Checks for ERC-721 Amount Invariant:
 Added checks within the _executeInteraction function to enforce that the specifiedAmount is always 1 for ERC-721 tokens, preventing incorrect token handling.

Stability of Primitive Contracts: 
Addressed medium-risk issues by ensuring that primitive contracts do not change unexpectedly after computeOutputAmount and computeInputAmount interactions.

Correct Reflection of Ether Transactions: 
Ensured that the amount of Ether being wrapped or unwrapped is accurately reflected in msg.value, crucial for transaction integrity.

Preventing Loss of Funds in Ocean Contract: 
Implemented checks to safeguard against potential fund losses in the Ocean contract, enhancing the security of the contract.

Security of computeOutputAmount Function in OceanAdapter: 
Ensured robustness and error handling in the computeOutputAmount function, mitigating risks associated with unexpected behaviors.

Token Minting Integrity: 
Addressed the risk of the Ocean contract minting tokens without first calling the contract used for calculating its token ID, ensuring proper sequence of operations.

Handling Rebasing and Fee-on-Transfer Tokens: 
Tackled the complexities of rebasing tokens and fee-on-transfer tokens interacting with the Ocean contract, a medium-risk issue affecting token balance accuracy.

Balance Tracking in Interactions: 
Ensured accurate tracking and updating of token balances during doInteraction or doMultipleInteractions calls, crucial for maintaining correct ledger states.

Fee Distribution to Ocean Owner: 
Implemented mechanisms to ensure that fees are correctly credited to the Ocean owner's ERC-1155 balance, addressing medium-risk concerns related to fee allocation.

Validations in primitiveOutputAmount Function: 
Enhanced the security and reliability of the primitiveOutputAmount function through rigorous validations, mitigating medium-risk vulnerabilities.

Integrity in Token Wrapping/Unwrapping in Curve2PoolAdapter: 
Ensured the robustness of token wrapping and unwrapping processes in the Curve2PoolAdapter contract, crucial for maintaining transaction integrity.

These findings collectively enhance the security, functionality, and reliability of the Shell Protocol, addressing medium-risk vulnerabilities and ensuring a more robust and secure DeFi platform.
