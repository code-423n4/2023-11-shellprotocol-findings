The audit findings for the Shell Protocol's Ocean contract reveal several areas of medium risk that require attention to enhance security and reliability. Here's a summary:

Loss of Funds Prevention:
Risk Level: Medium
Finding: Implement checks to prevent fund loss, particularly in scenarios involving rounding errors or incorrect calculations.
Security of computeOutputAmount Function:

Risk Level: Medium
Finding: Secure the computeOutputAmount function in the OceanAdapter contract against errors or unexpected behaviors.
Token ID Calculation Check:

Risk Level: Medium
Finding: Ensure the Ocean contract doesn't mint tokens without first calling the contract used for calculating their token ID.
Handling Rebasing and Fee-on-Transfer Tokens:

Risk Level: Medium
Finding: Address challenges arising from interactions between rebasing tokens or fee-on-transfer tokens and the Ocean contract.
Balances Tracking in Interactions:

Risk Level: Medium
Finding: Ensure accurate tracking and updating of token balances during doInteraction or doMultipleInteractions calls.
Fee Crediting to Ocean Owner:

Risk Level: Medium
Finding: Guarantee that fees are correctly credited to the Ocean owner's ERC-1155 balance within the Ocean contract.
Validations in primitiveOutputAmount Function:

Risk Level: Medium
Finding: Incorporate stringent validations in the primitiveOutputAmount function for enhanced security and reliability.
Integrity of Wrapping/Unwrapping in Curve2PoolAdapter:

Risk Level: Medium
Finding: Ensure robustness and security in the token wrapping and unwrapping processes within the Curve2PoolAdapter contract.

Overall, these findings point towards a need for stringent checks, better error handling, and enhanced validation procedures to bolster the security and functionality of the Shell Protocol's Ocean contract, particularly in aspects related to token interactions, fee management, and the integrity of crucial functions.
