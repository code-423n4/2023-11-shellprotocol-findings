There are a few things for improvement that I found:

Modularization and Single Responsibility

 The Ocean contract appears to aggregate several functionalities, such as wrapping/unwrapping tokens, fee management, and interaction execution. Consider refactoring the contract into smaller, more focused contracts with single responsibilities. This can improve code maintainability and testability.

State Machine Management
   - The usage of constants like NOT_INTERACTION and INTERACTION to manage the state of ERC1155 and ERC721 interactions indicates a form of state machine. Use an enum to clearly define the interaction states. This makes the contract more readable and reduces the chance of errors.

Token Registration
  The contract assumes all tokens to be interacted with are already known and mapped to their respective Ocean IDs. There is no explicit mechanism for token registration or validation.  Implement a token registration feature with proper checks, if not already present, to enforce better control over supported tokens.

Lack of Rate Limiting
  The contract does not employ any rate limiting on function calls which could potentially lead to abuse or denial of service. Introduce mechanisms like gas or rate limits where applicable to mitigate potential abuse.

Access Control
 The contract uses OpenZeppelin's ownership pattern, but it's unclear if all admin functions are adequately protected. Ensure that all sensitive functions have proper access control mechanisms in place beyond just onlyOwner.



Storage vs Memory
  There are multiple instances where variables are declared that could potentially be moved to memory instead of storage for gas optimization. Carefully analyze state variables and local variables to determine if they can be stored in memory to save gas.

Loops and Gas Optimizations
 The _doMultipleInteractions method iterates over arrays, which could lead to high gas costs for large sets of interactions. Look for batch processing techniques and limit the number of interactions per transaction to prevent excessive gas costs.
