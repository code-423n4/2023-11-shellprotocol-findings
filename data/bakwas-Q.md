  "Risk rating": "Low",
  "Issue type": "Input Ambiguity and Lack of Constraints",
  "Title": "Potential Input Length Ambiguity in _calculateOceanId Function",
  "Vulnerability details": {
    "impact": "The use of abi.encodePacked for concatenating inputs without padding could theoretically introduce ambiguity if variable-length inputs were used. However, since Ethereum addresses and uint256 values have fixed lengths, this risk is mitigated in the current context.",
    "proof of concept": "In the current implementation, the risk is low because Ethereum addresses are always 20 bytes and uint256 values are always 32 bytes, which prevents ambiguity in the byte representation. The function does not exhibit input length ambiguity under these conditions.",
    "suggestion steps": {
      "code snippet": "While the current implementation is not vulnerable to input length ambiguity, it is good practice to document the fixed-length assumption for future maintainers of the code.",
      "code": {
        "solidity": [
          "// Assumes tokenAddress is an Ethereum address (20 bytes) and tokenId is a uint256 (32 bytes)",
          "// These fixed lengths prevent input length ambiguity in the keccak256 hash",
          "function _calculateOceanId(address tokenAddress, uint256 tokenId) internal pure returns (uint256) {",
          "    return uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(tokenAddress, tokenId)));",
