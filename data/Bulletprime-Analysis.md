1.1 Description overview of shell 
The shell v3 is a significant enhancement to the shell v2, which is a defi infrasrutre that seamlessly and efficiently compose any type of primitive: AMMs, lending pools, algorithmic stablecoins, NFT markets, and even primitives yet to be invented. The primary objective of this upgrade is to improve `The Ocean` i; design change ii; improving the general code base by Adding ETH wraps to `doInteraction`,Splitting the update to the primitive's balances in the compute interactions refactored the order in which a primitive's balances are updated. , Adding some custom errors. OpenZeppelin libriaries and interfaces tools were highly leveraged to achieve this. The upgrade process is detailed in the projects technical documents which provides a comprehensive blueprint for the upgrade’s implementation and reason.

1.2 Goal
To basically connet web3 project (primitive) in a large network making it simpler providing an affordable batch complex transations using shells networked composability.

1.3 Important contracts
`Ocean.sol` this part of the contract oversees the accounting engine of the shell protocol.
`Curve2PoolAdapter.sol`	Adapter that enables integration with the curve 2 pool	
`CurveTricryptoAdapter.sol` Another	Adapter that enables integration with the curve tricrypto pool	
`OceanAdapter.sol` The Helper contract for all the adapters.

Security commendations 
1. The most important security point of Shell protocol is contracts are non-custodial, no-one,not even the team of Shell DAO is able to access the funds held in any of the core contracts. 
2. Shell conducts security monitoring on-chain . The Shell bot allows anyone to subscribe to updates. This bot tracks Shell transactions that involve wrapping, unwrapping, swapping, depositing, or withdrawals over a certain amount. If transactions occur with unusually high token amounts, the bot sends out an alert.

Code base approach
2.1 Audit Documentation and Scope

 Initial step involved, was thoroghly examining `audit documentation and scope` with full knowledge on the problem the v1 & v2 projecet were trying to solve to proper grasp the v3 contract functionalities and boundaries, and prioritise my efforts. It is worth highlighting the good quality of the `README`for this audit, as it provided valuable insights and actionable guidance that greatly facilitated the onboarding process.

2.2 Imports and external calls  
A good amount of hour was put into analysing the interfaes and external calls used, as the contrats code used libriaries and interfaces  from open zepplein, it was important to review the imported contracts and interfaces for proper implementation, tested and reviewed to reveal potential vulnerabilities. 

2.3 Setup and Testing

Setting up test environment to execute `forge test` was remarkably effortless, greatly enhancing the efficiency of the auditing process. With a fully functional test tap at my disposal, which not only accelerate the testing of intricate concepts and potential vulnerabilities but also gain insights into the developer’s expectations regarding functions implementation. Foundry tests for coverage were also analyzed and considered.

2.4 Code review

The code review commenced with understanding the `implementation pattern” used to manage authorization and functionality accross the system. From the v1-v2 up to the v3 implementation. Thoroughly understanding this pattern made understanding the protocol contracts and its relations much smoother. Throughout this stage, I documented observations and raised questions concerning potential exploits without going too deep. Assuming nothing while questioning everything.

2.5 Threat Modelling

At this point I began formulating specific assumptions that, if compromised, could pose security risks to the system. This process aids me in determining the most effective exploitation strategies. Thoroughly examining and marking any doubtful or vulnerable areas within the protocol, diving deep into these areas, performing in-depth examinations, and subjecting them to rigorous testing to report these issues if they checkout or not.

2.6 known Finding 
Read old audits and already known findings. Went through the bot races findings checking what was found so as to not report these issues again, while bearing in mind the kind of bugs the contract is concerned about plus invariants 

2.7 Report Issues
I started with auditing the code base indepthly this way I started understanding line by line code and took the necessary notes to ask questions, marking out vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited, This assessment helps in evaluating whether these exploits can be strategically combined to create a more significant impact on the system’s security. In some cases, seemingly minor and moderate issues can compound to form a critical vulnerability when leveraged wisely. This has to be balanced with any risks that users may face.

3.1 Architecture overview
The platform supports a generic implementation,The architecture of the Shell Protocol is quite innovative and forward-thinking. The Ocean serves as a shared multi-token ledger, a standardized accounting framework for DeFi primitives, and a system for composing these primitives. This allows for a more efficient and simpler way to compose DeFi operations.
The `Proteus` tool is particularly interesting as it can precisely implement any trading strategy, allowing for concentrated liquidity with fungible LP tokens and bonding curves that can evolve over time. This flexibility is a key strength of the Shell Protocol, as it allows for the creation of custom AMMs without the need to write codes. Recommendation would be to provide more detailed documentation and examples of how to work with the `Ocean` and `Proteus`. While the flexibility of these tools is a great strength, it can also be a bit daunting for developers and n'users who are not familiar with the intricacies of DeFi. Clear and comprehensive documentation would help to lower the barrier to entry and make it easier for n'users to work with the protocol. Additionally, providing tools and resources to help understand and work with the protocol would also be valuable.

4.1 Code comments 
Code quality and documentation is very mature. The test suite is pretty comprehensive and fuzz tests are a great way to complement the static tests. The code is well-structured and follows best practices for smart contract development. For instance, the `changeUnwrapFee` function includes check to ensure that the new fee is not set to a value that would be too large. This is a good practice as it helps to prevent potential issues such as integer overflow.

The use of events, such as `ChangeUnwrapFee` and `OceanTransaction`, is also a good practice. Events are a way for contracts to communicate that something has happened on the blockchain to your app front-end, which can be useful for tracking changes in the contract state.
Overall, the code demonstrates a good understanding of Ethereum smart contract development and is a solid implementation of the core functionality of the Ocean component of the Shell Protocol.

5.1 Centralization risks
Using an externally owned account (EOA) as the owner of contracts can lead to significant risks of centralization and represents a vulnerable single point of failure. This is because a single private key can be susceptible to theft during an exploiting incident, or the sole possessor of the key may encounter difficulties in retrieving it when required. To mitigate these risks, it is advisable to transition to a multi-signature arrangement or implement a role-based authorization framework. This would involve having multiple private keys involved in the signing process, increasing the security of the system. Additionally, it's important to ensure that each role has a clear set of tasks and that no one person has too much power over the system. This can help to distribute the responsibility and reduce the risk of centralization or a single point of failure.

```File: src/ocean/Ocean.sol

196:     function changeUnwrapFee(uint256 nextUnwrapFeeDivisor) external override onlyOwner {
```
The `changeUnwrapFee` function, as it stands, poses a centralization risk because it can only be executed by the owner of the contract. This means that the owner has complete control over the fee structure, which could lead to centralization if the owner were to abuse this power.
To mitigate this risk, it's advisable to transition to a multi-signature arrangement or implement a role-based authorization framework. In a multi-signature arrangement, multiple parties would need to sign off on any changes, increasing the security of the system. In a role-based authorization framework, different roles would have different levels of access, and no one person would have complete control over the system.
For instance, the `changeUnwrapFee` function could be modified to require multiple signatures for any fee changes. This would involve having multiple private keys involved in the signing process, increasing the security of the system. Additionally, it's important to ensure that each role has a clear set of tasks and that no one person has too much power over the system. This can help to distribute the responsibility and reduce the risk of centralization or a single point of failure.

 System Risk
Third-Party Dependency Risk: AS Contracts rely on external data source, such as @openzeppelin/interface and libries, and there is a risk that if any issues are found with these dependencies in your contracts, the shell protocol could also be affected. I also observed that old versions of solidity are used in the project, and these should be updated to the latest version
Update Risk: As this smart contract needs to be updated and an upgrade, there is a risk that updates may be implemented incorrectly or that new versions introduce vulnerabilities.
Smart Contract Vulnerability Risk: Smart contracts can contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers, cause of the use of inheritance. If a smart contract has critical security flaws, such as access errors or logic problems, this could lead to asset loss or system manipulation. We strongly recommend that, once the protocol is audited, necessary actions be taken to mitigate any issues identified by C4 Wardens. The team should prepare multiple recovery scenarios and set up adequate action channels to prepare for eventualities.
Test Coverage Risks: The test coverage of this protocol also shows there may have undiscovered vulnerabilities. Inadequate security audits could leave critical issues unnoticed, increasing the risk of attacks.
The Shell Protocol V3, which uses version 0.8.20 of Solidity, faces a systemic risk of non-functionality on certain Layer 2 networks due to the new PUSH0 opcode. This opcode is not yet implemented on all Layer 2 networks, which means that deployment of contracts using this opcode will fail on these networks.
For instance, the contract might fail to deploy on Arbitrum, which would render it completely non-functional. This is a significant risk as it could potentially disrupt the entire protocol on these networks.
To work around this issue, it's recommended to use an earlier version of the EVM, such as 0.8.19, which does not include the new PUSH0 opcode. This would ensure that the contract can be deployed and function properly on all Layer 2 networks.
As a recommendation, it would be beneficial to closely monitor the progress of the implementation of the PUSH0 opcode on these networks and adjust the deployment of the contracts accordingly. This would help to ensure that the contracts can function properly on all networks, reducing the risk of non-functionality and potential disruption to the protocol.
Remember, security is a continuous process and these are just some initial observations. A thorough security review and testing are recommended to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.
