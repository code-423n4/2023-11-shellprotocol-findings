# Contracts Overview

**Ocean.sol**  
`Ocean`, is part of a DeFi framework developed by Cowri Labs Inc. This contract is designed to interact with various token standards like ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, and custom primitives through a multitoken ledger system. It allows users to perform a series of interactions with these tokens, such as wrapping, unwrapping, and computing input/output amounts for trades.

### key components and potential security considerations:

1.  **Version and Imports:** This contract is written for version 0.8.20 and imports interfaces and utility libraries from OpenZeppelin, as well as other components of the ShellV2 system.
    
2.  **Contract Overview**: The `Ocean` contract acts as a DeFi framework, an accounting system, and an ERC-1155 ledger. It allows for complex interactions with various token types and external contracts.
    
3.  **Events**: This contract emits events for wrapping and unwrapping ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 tokens, as well as for Ether and interactions with primitives.
    
4.  **Constructor**: Initializes the contract, setting the fee divisor to the maximum possible value, effectively setting the initial fee to zero.
    
5.  **Modifiers**:
    
    - `onlyApprovedForwarder`: Ensures that only approved forwarders can call certain functions on behalf of a user.
6.  **Fee Management**: The contract allows the owner to change the unwrap fee divisor, which affects the fees charged for unwrapping tokens.
    
7.  **Interaction Functions**: The contract provides functions to execute single or multiple interactions, both directly and through an approved forwarder. These functions handle the logic for wrapping and unwrapping tokens, as well as interacting with external contracts (primitives).
    
8.  **ERC-1155 and ERC-721 Receiver Functions**: Implements the necessary functions to comply with the ERC-1155 and ERC-721 receiver interfaces, allowing the contract to handle incoming token transfers.
    
9.  **Internal Logic**:
    
    - `_doInteraction` and `_doMultipleInteractions`: Core functions that execute the specified interactions and update the internal accounting system accordingly.
    - `_executeInteraction`: Determines the logic for each interaction type, such as wrapping or unwrapping tokens, and computes input/output amounts for trading with primitives.
10. **Security Considerations**:
    
    - The contract uses OpenZeppelin's `SafeERC20` library for safe token transfers, which helps prevent issues with token transfers.
    - Reentrancy protection is implemented using status variables for ERC-1155 and ERC-721 interactions.
    - The contract uses a pull-over-push strategy for token transfers, which is generally safer and prevents reentrancy attacks.
    - The contract does not allow recursive wrapping of its own token (ERC-1155), which prevents potential exploits.
    - The contract uses a fee system for unwrapping tokens, which could be a point of contention if not managed transparently by governance.
    - The contract assumes that external contracts (primitives) will behave correctly and not revert unexpectedly, which could be a risk if interacting with untrusted contracts.

**Curve2PoolAdapter.sol**

`Curve2PoolAdapter`  is an adapter for interacting with a Curve Finance 2pool, specifically for swapping between two tokens, adding liquidity, and removing liquidity. The contract inherits from `OceanAdapter`, which is not provided but is assumed to handle some aspects of interaction with a platform called Ocean.

### key components and potential security considerations:

1.  **Immutables and State Variables:**
    
    - `xToken`, `yToken`, and `lpTokenId` are immutable variables representing Ocean IDs for the two tokens in the Curve pool and the liquidity provider (LP) token, respectively.
    - `indexOf` is a mapping from Ocean IDs to Curve pool indices.
    - `decimals` is a mapping from Ocean IDs to token decimals.
2.  **Constructor:**
    
    - Initializes the contract by setting up the tokens, their indices, and decimals.
    - Approves the Ocean platform and the Curve pool to spend the contract's tokens to the maximum possible amount (`type(uint256).max`).
3.  **Token Wrapping and Unwrapping:**
    
    - `wrapToken` and `unwrapToken` are internal functions that handle wrapping and unwrapping tokens into the Ocean platform's format.
4.  **Primitive Output Amount Calculation:**
    
    - `primitiveOutputAmount` is an internal function that determines the action to take (swap, deposit, or withdraw) based on the input and output tokens.
    - It performs the action using the Curve pool and checks if the output amount is above a specified minimum to protect against slippage.
    - Emits corresponding events for each action.
5.  **Compute Type Determination:**
    
    - `_determineComputeType` is a private view function that determines the type of computation (swap, deposit, or withdraw) based on the input and output tokens.
6.  **Security Considerations:**
    
    - The contract uses `immutable` for variables that are set once and do not change, which is good for gas optimization.
    - The contract uses OpenZeppelin's `IERC20Metadata` interface, which is a standard and secure way to interact with ERC20 tokens.
    - The contract has error handling for invalid compute types and slippage limits exceeded.
    - The contract approves the maximum possible amount of tokens to be spent by the Ocean platform and the Curve pool. This is a common pattern but can be risky if either the Ocean platform or the Curve pool contracts are compromised.
    - The contract assumes that the `primitive` address provided is a legitimate Curve pool. There should be checks to ensure that the address is a valid Curve pool contract.
    - The contract does not check for integer overflows or underflows. However, since Solidity 0.8.x, these checks are built-in, so this is not a concern unless the contract interacts with other contracts that do not have these checks.
    - The contract does not validate the tokens being passed in; it assumes that the tokens are part of the Curve pool. Malicious input could potentially cause unexpected behavior.
    - The contract emits events with the `primitive` address as the `user`, which might be a mistake. Typically, the user would be the address calling the function, not the address of the Curve pool.

&nbsp; **CurveTricryptoAdapter.sol**

`CurveTricryptoAdapter`  acts as an adapter for interacting with the Curve Tricrypto pool. The Curve Tricrypto pool is a liquidity pool that allows for swapping between USDT, WBTC, and ETH, as well as adding and removing liquidity.

### key components and potential security considerations:

1.  **Contract Inheritance**: This contract inherits from `OceanAdapter`, which is not provided in the snippet but presumably handles some common logic for interacting with the Ocean protocol.
    
2.  **Immutables**: The contract defines immutable variables for the Ocean IDs of the tokens involved in the Curve pool (xToken, yToken, zToken) and the liquidity pool token (lpTokenId).
    
3.  **Mappings**: There are mappings to keep track of the index of each token in the Curve pool (`indexOf`) and the decimals for each token (`decimals`).
    
4.  **Constructor**: The constructor initializes the immutables, sets up the mappings, and approves the tokens for spending by the Ocean protocol and the Curve pool.
    
5.  **Token Wrapping and Unwrapping**: The `wrapToken` and `unwrapToken` functions handle the wrapping and unwrapping of tokens into and out of the Ocean protocol, respectively. Special handling is included for Ether (WETH).
    
6.  **Primitive Output Amount**: The `primitiveOutputAmount` function is the core logic for swapping, depositing, and withdrawing from the Curve pool. It determines the type of action to take based on the input and output tokens, performs the action, and checks for slippage.
    
7.  **Events**: The contract emits events for swaps, deposits, and withdrawals, providing details about the transactions.
    
8.  **Fallback Function**: A fallback function is included to allow the contract to receive Ether.
    

**Potential Security Flaws and Considerations**:

- **Reentrancy**: The contract interacts with external contracts (Curve pool and Ocean protocol) but does not appear to have reentrancy protection. However, since the Solidity version is 0.8.20, it includes built-in checks against overflows and underflows, which mitigates some reentrancy risks.
    
- **Slippage Control**: The contract checks for slippage by comparing the minimum expected output amount with the actual output amount. If the actual amount is less than the minimum, it reverts with `SLIPPAGE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`. This is a good practice to prevent front-running and ensure users get a fair exchange rate.
    
- **Approval of Max Tokens**: The contract approves the maximum possible number of tokens for the Ocean protocol and the Curve pool. This is a common pattern but can be risky if either of those contracts has a vulnerability that allows for unauthorized spending.
    
- **Use of `address(this).balance`**: The contract uses `address(this).balance` to get the balance of Ether in the contract. This is generally safe, but care must be taken to ensure that no functions can be exploited to manipulate the contract's Ether balance unexpectedly.
    
- **Fallback Function**: The contract includes a fallback function to receive Ether. This is necessary for the contract to handle Ether operations, but it should be ensured that no other functionality can be triggered through this fallback function.
    
- **Error Handling**: The contract uses custom errors (`INVALID_COMPUTE_TYPE()` and `SLIPPAGE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED()`) which is a gas-efficient way to handle errors compared to the older `require` statements with error messages.
    
- **Decentralization and Trust**: The contract relies on the Curve pool and Ocean protocol, which means it inherits their trust assumptions and potential centralization risks.

**OceanAdapter.sol**

`OceanAdapter`, intended to be a helper contract for shell adapters within a system that appears to involve a token exchange or liquidity mechanism, is referred to as the "Ocean". The contract implements the `IOceanPrimitive` interface, which is not shown in the code snippet but is assumed to define the functions that `OceanAdapter` overrides.

### key components and potential security considerations:

1.  **Contract Metadata**: The contract specifies the MIT license and is associated with Cowri Labs Inc.
    
2.  **Version Pragma**: The contract is compiled with Solidity version 0.8.20, which includes important safety features like overflow checks.
    
3.  **Imports**: The contract imports the `IERC20` interface from OpenZeppelin, which is a library of secure smart contract components. It also imports two local modules, `IOceanPrimitive` and `Interactions`, which are not provided in the snippet.
    
4.  **Constructor**: Initializes the `ocean` and `primitive` addresses.
    
5.  **Modifiers**:
    
    - `onlyOcean`: A modifier that restricts function access to the Ocean contract only.
6.  **Functions**:
    
    - `computeOutputAmount`: Given an input token, output token, and input amount, it calculates the output amount after unwrapping the input token and applying a fee. It then calls `primitiveOutputAmount` to determine the output amount based on the unwrapped amount and wraps the output token before returning the amount.
    - `computeInputAmount`: This function is not implemented and reverts when called. It's meant to compute the input amount given an output amount, but its functionality is not provided in this contract.
    - `_fetchInteractionId`: A utility function to create an interaction ID based on a token address and an interaction type.
    - `_calculateOceanId`: A utility function to calculate an Ocean ID for a token based on its address and a token ID.
    - `onERC1155Received`: A function to comply with the ERC1155 token receiver interface, allowing this contract to receive ERC1155 tokens.
    - `getTokenSupply`: Returns 0 for any token ID, indicating that this primitive should not hold any tokens.
    - `_convertDecimals`: A utility function to convert amounts between different decimal bases.
    - `primitiveOutputAmount`, `wrapToken`, `unwrapToken`: Abstract internal functions that must be implemented by derived contracts to handle specific logic related to the primitive's operations.

**Potential Security Flaws**:

- The `computeOutputAmount` function does not validate the input or output token IDs, which could be a problem if the derived contract does not implement proper checks.
- The division operation in `computeOutputAmount` to calculate the `unwrapFee` could potentially result in integer division rounding errors. However, since Solidity 0.8.x includes overflow checks, there is no risk of overflow here.
- The contract assumes that the `primitive` address is a trusted and secure contract. If the `primitive` contract is vulnerable or malicious, it could affect the `OceanAdapter`.
- The `onlyOcean` modifier ensures that only the Ocean contract can call certain functions, but if the Ocean contract itself is compromised, it could lead to unauthorized actions.
