# New primitives cannot override `OceanAdapter.computeInputAmount`, rendering all `Ocean._computeInputAmount` logic useless

Because `OceanAdapter.computeInputAmount` does not have a `virtual`, it cannot be overwritten by new primitives. The function will, therefore, always revert:

```solidity
    function computeInputAmount(
        uint256 inputToken,
        uint256 outputToken,
        uint256 outputAmount,
        address userAddress,
        bytes32 maximumInputAmount
    )
        external
        override
        onlyOcean
        returns (uint256 inputAmount)
    {
        revert();
    }
```

As a consequence, what was meant to be a helper contract for shell adapters can actually only be used for primitives which don't require `computeInputAmount`. All logic in the Ocean contract regarding `computeInputAmount` functions becomes useless, and this interaction type remains unusable.

As a mitigation, that function should have a `virtual` keyword to make it overrideable.
